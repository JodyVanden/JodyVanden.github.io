I have a mechanical engineer degree and when I moved to Australia I found out
that the industry in manufacturing here is not as big as I though. This is why
I am doing a career change and try to go into Ruby dev. I chose Ruby as a
language because it is friendly, massivly used in Australia and with a strong
community.
I know that inversting in junior might be annoying. But I am a fast learner
and want to succed in this industry. And I know that technicaly I am not the
best right now in the dev industry, but as a formal mechanical engineer I had
to deal with a lot of technical problems.
